## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Microsoft has decided to open a new branch of their company: Microsoft Movie Studios. However, they need help in assessing the different attributes of movies that bring in the most success. Therefore, I have been tasked with aiding the new head of Microsoft Movie Studios in making decisions regarding what type of films to create through the use of data analysis. 

## Data

The data that I used for this analysis comes from two datasets: IMDb and Box Office Mojo. These sources include information about ratings and lengths of various films, genres, directors, actors and actresses, and total gross earnings (foreign and domestic); such data primarily comes from the years 2010 - 2018.

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
