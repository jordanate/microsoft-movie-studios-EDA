## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Microsoft has decided to open a new branch of their company: Microsoft Movie Studios. However, they need help in assessing the different attributes of movies that bring in the most success. Therefore, I have been tasked with aiding the new head of Microsoft Movie Studios in making decisions regarding what type of films to create through the use of data analysis. 

## Data

The data that I used for this analysis comes from two datasets: IMDb and Box Office Mojo. These sources include information about ratings and lengths of various films, genres, directors, actors and actresses, and total gross earnings (foreign and domestic); such data primarily comes from the years 2010 - 2018.

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?

## Conclusions

This analysis brings about 4 recommendations for Microsoft Movie Studios

1. **The top two genres with the greatest revenue are Action and Adventure.** Although Documentaries tend to be the highest rated genre, ratings do not neccessarily equal success for a business. Rather, revenue is a more appropriate indicator. The genres that clearly had the highest average total revenue (domestic gross + foreign gross) were Adventure movies and Action movies.

2. **Suggested runtime is 101 minutes.** There is no distinct difference in runtime between movies that are rated as 'Good', 'Average' or 'Bad', but if Microsoft Movie Studios is looking for a target runtime, 101 minutes is a good marker as it is the average runtime of 'Good' movies from the two most successful genres: Action and Adventure.

3. **Directors to target are Sam Mendes, Michael Bay, Lee Unkrich, Pierre Coffin, Anthony Russo, and Christopher Nolan**: While there are many successful directors in the film industry, the listed directors have shown to surpass the standard when it comes to the revenue that their movies produce. Not only have these indivudals directed some of the most successful movies in the datasets, but they have also exhibited continuous success throughout the careers.   
4. **Actors to target are Sandra Bullock, Javier Bardem, and Chris Evans**: Similar to the directors presented above, these actors have appeared in the most successful movies from this dataset. Even more so, they have been consistently cast in successful movies throughout the years 2010-2018. Therefore, including such actors in Microsoft films will likely bring in high revenue as well as positive reviews from the audience.
